This is a conversion of the Maple Code given in the Paper 'Phase Portraits of Hyperbolic Geometry' by Scott B. Lindstrom and Paul Vrbik (2019), Link: (https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01309)
The Code of which can be found here: https://nova.newcastle.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/uon:29853;jsessionid=841F75A945070507980F896F8D6124AE?view=null&f0=sm_creator%3A%22Lindstrom%2C+Scott%22&sort=sort_ss_title+desc

This Project also serves to translate the Maple Code given in the Paper 'Proximal Averages for Minimization of Entropy Functionals' by Heinz H. Bauschke and Scott B. Lindstrom Link: (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.08878.pdf)
The Code of which can be found here:
Plots Code: https://github.com/lindstromscott/Heat-Plots-for-Homotopy/tree/main
Entropy Code: https://github.com/lindstromscott/Entropy-Functional-Optimization/tree/main/Proximal%20averages%20for%20minimization%20of%20entropy%20functionals


This Project serves to be a unified Python Translation of the Maple Code which includes Functionality of Visualizing Complex Functions using PhasePlots along with Angle Lines as well as Heatplots Functionality for Visualizaing Homotopies.
